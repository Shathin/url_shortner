# URL Shortner

This project involves the development of a URL shortening service. Users will be able to submit long, unwieldy URLs and receive a shortened, easy-to-share version that redirects to the original website.

### Core Features:

### Additional Features:
- ‚úçüèº **Custom URLs**: Allow users to personalize the shortened URL with a custom word or phrase.
- üìà **Analytics**: Provide basic statistics on shortened links, such as the number of clicks, referral sources, or geographic location of visitors.
- üîê **Password Protection**: Option to require a password to access a shortened URL for added privacy.
- üíª **API**: Develop an API to enable integration with other applications or services.

### Technologies:
